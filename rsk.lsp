;; What is RSK?
;;
;; RSK ("Reverse SKolemisation") compiles away PDDL3.1 object fluents.
;;
;; The fundamental operation in this compilation is to replace functions
;; (object fluents) with existentially quantified variables, which is
;; essentially Skolemisation in reverse. I'm sure there are other names
;; for this operation.
;;
;; RSK can peform the rewrite to a greater or lesser degree. This is
;; controlled by the :target keyword parameter:
;;
;; The default (:target nil) is to only "flattens" fluent terms, i.e.,
;; to remove nested complex terms.
;;
;; With :target 'sas, in addition, equalities and assignments are
;; rewritten so that the right-hand-side is always an atomic term.
;; This means that the result after grounding will contain only
;; conditions/effects of the form "variable=value". (Though note that
;; RSK does not implement grounding.)
;;
;; With :target 'strips, object fluents are completely replaced by
;; predicates.

;; How do I run RSK?
;;
;; As with INVAL, RSK can be compiled to a stand-alone executable (with
;; a suitable LISP compiler), run as a script (with a suitable LISP
;; interpreter), or used interactively.
;;
;; rsk-main.lsp contains a main procedure for running it compiled or
;; as a script. If you have ECL, running the script compile-with-ecl
;; should produce an executable, named "rsk". Run it without arguments
;; for some help.
;;
;; Note: There seems to be a bug in ECLs formatted printing. Sometimes
;; the output comes out slightly mangled (particularly at the start of
;; a line).
;;
;; To run interactively, the steps are:
;;
;; 1. Load inval.lsp and rsk.lsp;
;;
;; 2. Call
;;
;;  (load-files "my-domain.pddl" "my-problem.pddl")
;;
;; to load a domain/problem definition.
;;
;; 3. Call
;;
;;  (rsk-domain *domain-name* REQS *objects* *types* *predicates*
;;              *functions* *axioms* *actions* [:target TARGET])
;;
;; where REQS is a list of the keywords you want to appear in the
;; :requirements section of the domain (there is no smart code to figure
;; this out automatically) and TARGET is the formalism you want to
;; compile to ('sas or 'strips; to flatten only, the keyword parameter
;; can be left out). The function returns two values: the first is the
;; compiled domain, and the second is a list of constants that have been
;; declared in the domain. Only objects that appear in (compiled) actions
;; or axioms are declared as domain constants; this is necessary for the
;; compiled domain to pass VAL's syntax check. To disable the use of
;; domain constants (some planners are allergic to them), add the keyword
;; argument ":declare-constants nil". Note that the special constant
;; "undefined", defined as part of the PDDL3.1 syntax, should not appear
;; in the result of compiling to strips (if it does, it is probably
;; because it was used in an invalid way in the input domain).
;; An additional keyword parameter, :static-fun, can be used to provide
;; a list of names of functions that will not be rsk'd. The purpose of
;; this is to easy subsequent grounding by reducing the number of action
;; parameters and quantifiers; if the intent is to ground the transformed
;; domain, static function terms can be simplified to a constant after
;; parameters have been instantiated.
;;
;; 4. Call
;;
;;  (rsk-problem *problem-name* *domain-name* *objects* *types*
;;               *functions* *init* *goal* *metric-type* *metric*
;;               LIST-OF-CONSTS [:target TARGET])
;;
;; where LIST-OF-CONSTS is the list of names of constants already declared
;; in the domain (i.e., the second value returned by rsk-domain); this is
;; needed to avoid declaring them twice. The function returns the compiled
;; problem.
