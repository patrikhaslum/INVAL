;; What is INVAL?
;;
;; INVAL is the Independent PDDL Plan Validator.
;;
;; INVAL is a PDDL plan validator based on my understanding of the
;; PDDL semantics, as they are defined in:
;;
;; Fox & Long, "PDDL2.1: An Extension to PDDL for Expressing Temporal
;;  Planning Domains". Journal of AI Research, vol. 20, 2003.
;;
;; Thiebaux, Hoffman & Nebel, "In Defense of PDDL Axioms". Artificial
;;  Intelligence, vol. 168, 2005.
;;
;; http://ipc.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/PddlExtension.
;;
;; Gerevini, Haslum, Long, Saetti, Dimopoulos, "Deterministic planning
;;  in the 5th international planning competition: PDDL3 and experimental
;;  evaluation of the planners". Artificial Intelligence, vol. 173(5-6),
;;  pp. 619-668, 2009.
;;
;; http://zeus.ing.unibs.it/ipc-5/bnf.pdf (PDDL3 syntax).

;; So if INVAL and VAL disagree, which is right?
;;
;; One of them. Or they could both be wrong.
;;
;; If you find an example where VAL and INVAL disagee on the validity,
;; or metric value, of a plan, this may indicate that one of the two
;; validators is incorrect, or that there is an area where the PDDL
;; semantics are less than crystal clear.
;;
;; First, check that the domain and problem are absolutely, perfectly
;; correct PDDL, and that they are really within the subset of PDDL
;; that INVAL can handle (see list of known bugs and limitations below).
;; Also check that your settings of the configuration options match VALs.
;;
;; If the discrepancy persists in spite of all the above checks, please
;; inform the developers of both validators.


;; How do I run INVAL?
;;
;; There are three ways to run INVAL:
;;
;; 1. Interactively.
;;
;; Load this file into your favourite Common LISP interpreter, and do
;; the following:
;;
;; i) To load domain and problem definitions, do
;;
;; (load-files "my-domain.pddl" "my-problem.pddl")
;;
;; ii) To load and validate a plan, do
;;
;; (setq my-plan (parse-plan "my plan" (read-file "my-problem.soln")))
;; (validate-plan (car my-plan) (cdr my-plan) *init* *goal* *constraints*
;;                *metric* *actions* (stratify *axioms*) *types* *objects*)
;;
;; (the seventh argument can be replaced with nil if the domain doesn't
;; use derived predicates).
;;
;; 2. As a script.
;;
;; Some CL interpreters (e.g., GCL, ECL) have a feature that allows them
;; to be used as script executors (in the same way as, e.g., bash or
;; perl). To make this work, make sure the first line (#!/...) and the
;; load call in inval-main.lsp are uncommented (you may also need to
;; edit the paths, and select/write an appropriate version of the
;; get-commandline-args function, which differs between interpreters),
;; and make the file executable. It should then be runnable like any
;; other script:
;;
;; inval-main.lsp <domain file> <problem file> <plan file>+
;;
;; See GCL documentation (-f option) / ECL documentation (-shell option)
;; for more information.
;;
;; 3. Compiling a stand-alone executable.
;;
;; I've got this to work with ECL. If you have ECL, just running the
;; script compile-with-ecl should produce an executable, named "inval".
;; It is invoked with the same arguments as in script form.


;; What are the known bugs and limitations?
;;
;; * INVAL does not handle temporal planning problems or temporal plans.
;;  It does work with parallel plans (i.e., the kind that graphplan,
;;  satplan and the like generate). See configuration options below for
;;  settings that affect the handling of parallel plans.
;;
;; * INVAL does not (normally) check that the domain/problem is correct,
;;  either syntactically, wrt types, or in any other way. If your input
;;  is not 100% correct PDDL, all bets are off.
;;
;;  A type-checking mechanism is implemented, but not used by the main
;;  validation function. To invoke it, load files (as above) and do
;;
;;  (type-check)
;;
;;  It returns nil if any problem was detected, t otherwise. Syntactic
;;  errors may cause the function to exit with an error. The "main"
;;  function (in inval-main.lsp) will run the type-checker if given
;;  the commandline option "-c".
;;
;; * There are a number of syntactic restrictions on input (mainly due
;;  to the fact that the first level of parsing is done by the standard
;;  LISP reader):
;;
;; - The symbol 'end-of-file is used internally to indicate end-of-file,
;;  so if the domain/problem contains a constant with that name, expect
;;  errors.
;;
;; - Similarly, if the domain/problem contains a constant (or predicate,
;;  or function, or anyting) named 'colon' or 'nil', strangeness will
;;  result.
;;
;; * The scale-up and scale-down numeric effect operators are not
;;  implemented.
;;
;; * Last but not least, INVAL is not efficient. On problems with complex
;;  action preconditions and/or effects, and particularly problems with
;;  derived predicates (axioms), it can be very slow. Be patient.

;; TODO's
;; * Should type-check-axiom check for conflicting parameter type
;;   declarations?
;; * type checking formulas and terms should use list of built-in
;;   numeric predicates/functions.
;; * violations of anonymous preferences are not added to metric value.
;; * remove polymorphic-actions support and other dead code.
;; * make type check return list of implied requirements (and check it
;;   against declared requirements).
;; * make printing at higher *verbosity* levels (3+) more consistent
;;   across different parts.

;;;;
;; Configuration options
;;
;; The behaviour of INVAL can be changed (slightly) by setting the
;; following variables.

;;;
;; Semantic options.
;;
;; These options modify how INVAL interprets PDDL and/or defines
;; plan validity.

;; Should two concurrent actions one of which adds an atom appearing
;; in the precondition (or an effect condition) of the other be
;; considered a conflict?
;;
;; The PDDL 2.1 spec very clearly answers yes (Definition 12, p. 93,
;; Fox & Long 2003). However, this form of concurrency is rampant in
;; graphplan/satplan-style plans, so we provide an option for allowing
;; it: set *add-read-are-mutex* to t to enforce the strict definition
;; (as per the PDDL spec) and to nil to allow concurrent add/reads.
(defvar *add-read-are-mutex* nil)

;; Are the parameter types given in an action definition to be regarded
;; as part of the actions precondition? (i.e., if a plan contains an
;; action instance with a non-type-matching argument, will that cause a
;; plan execution failure?)
;;
;; Although it does not appear to be formally stated in any of the PDDL
;; specifications, I believe the common view is that the answer should
;; be yes. However, allowing the possibility to relax this requirement
;; may be useful in some cases (e.g., to validate plans against action
;; definitions that take non-object arguments). Note that even if
;; *action-parameter-types-are-preconditions* is set to nil, the number
;; of arguments to each action must still match the number of parameters
;; (unless the *ignore-excess-arguments* option is true, cf. below).
(defvar *action-parameter-types-are-preconditions* t)

;; Can a type name be used as a (static) unary predicate in formulas?
;;
;; The PDDL 1.0 spec clearly says yes (McDermott et al. 1998, page 6).
;; VAL, however, says no. According to Derek, that's intentional: this
;; feature was ruled out from PDDL 2.1 and on. Some domains (e.g.,
;; freecell) declare predicates with the same names as types, which
;; would shadow type names used as predicates. VAL accepts domains in
;; which the same symbol is used both as a type and predicate name,
;; but assumes no association between the two.
;; If this option is set to true (t), type names implicitly define
;; static unary predicates, and these shadow any explicitly defined
;; unary predicate of the same name. If it is false, type names cannot
;; be used as predicates. (This option applies both to plan validation
;; and to domain/problem type checking.)
(defvar *type-names-are-predicates* nil)

;; Can a objects and types have multiple (super-)type declarations?
;;
;; There seems to be no indication for or against in any PDDL spec,
;; but VAL's answer is apparently "yes".
(defvar *multityping* t)

;; Are "(either ...)" types in declarations (type or object) conjunctive?
;;
;; The PDDL 1.0 and 1.2 specs say that "(either t1 .. tk) is the union
;; of types t1 to tk." (McDermott et al. 1998, page 6; Bacchus 2000,
;; page 4), which seems to imply the answer is "no". But VAL's answer
;; appears to be "yes".
(defvar *either-in-declarations-means-and* t)

;;;
;; Implementation options.
;;
;; These options only modify how some parts of validation is performed
;; (typically switching between alternative implementations) and their
;; setting should not affect whether a plan is considered valid or not.

;; Level of detail to print during plan validation (number, 0..)
;;  0 = print nothing
;;  1 = error and warning messages, final plan status and value
;;  2 = next happening, preference violations
;;  3 = states between happenings, action effects, axiom stratification
;;  4, 5 = more (and more) details about axiom evaluation.
(defvar *verbosity* 1)

;; Two alternative procedures for axiom stratification are implemented;
;; which one is used depends on the value of the configuration variable
;; *stratify-axioms-maximally*.
;;
;; If *stratify-axioms-maximally* is false, it uses the function
;; stratify-minimally, which implements the algorithm by Thiebaux,
;; Hoffmann & Nebel (2005). It outputs a stratification that is
;; "minimal", in the sense that it separates axioms into different
;; strata only when its strictly necessary for correctness (i.e.,
;; axioms in the higher stratum depend negatively on predicates defined
;; by axioms in the lower stratum).
;;
;; If *stratify-axioms-maximally* is true, it uses the function
;; stratify-maximally, which, in contrast, outputs a stratification
;; that is "maximal", in the sense that it places axioms together in
;; the same statum only when that is strictly necessary (i.e., when
;; the axioms are positively mutually dependent). Stratifying maximally
;; should lead to faster axiom evaluation (sometimes), since that
;; computes a fixpoint over application of all axioms in each stratum.
(defvar *stratify-axioms-maximally* nil)

;; Use alternative ("fast") implementation to compute axiom fixpoint.
;;
;; The basic implementation of axiom fixpoint computation (function
;; apply-axioms) is very simple. The alternative implementation
;; (function apply-axioms-2) is (hopefully) faster, but it is also way
;; more complicated (and thus more likely to be buggy) and has some
;; limitations. Currently, it does not support for numeric fluents in
;; any use. It does support object fluents, but only in "SAS form",
;; i.e., fluents can appear only in atomic formulas of the form
;; (= (f arg ... arg) val), where all arguments and the value are
;; atomic.
(defvar *fast-axiom-fixpoint* nil)

;;;
;; Non-standard options.
;;
;; These options enable various extensions/modifications to PDDL
;; semantics and/or the validation process, some of which are not
;; within the PDDL specification. They exist because I use INVAL
;; as platform for experimental language modification, and sometimes
;; as a component in other algorithms.

;; Are multiple action definitions with the same name allowed? If
;; polymorphic actions are enabled, the validator will choose the
;; action definition to use for each action in the plan among those
;; whose parameters match the given arguments; if there is more than
;; one matching action, it will then choose the one with the most
;; specific parameter types. If this is not enough to resolve the
;; ambiguity (i.e., there are two or more matching action definitions
;; of incomparable specificity), the validator considers it a plan
;; execution error.
(defvar *polymorphic-actions* nil)

;; Should excess arguments to an action be ignored (t), or treated as
;; an error (nil)? (This is sometimes useful to validate plans generated
;; with a compiled domain against the original domain definition.)
(defvar *ignore-excess-arguments* nil)

;; Should undefined actions be ignored (t), or treated as an error (nil)?
;; Note: If action polymorphism is enabled, ambiguous actions are still
;; treated as an error even if this option is set to true.

;; List of built-in numeric functions and predicates.

;; Plan validation

;; Validate a plan:
;; plan-name - the plan name (for trace printing)
;; plan - list of happenings; each happening is a list of action
;;   instances
;; state - starting state: list of (true) ground atoms and ground
;;   fluent equalities (same format as :init section of a PDDL problem
;;   definition)
;; goal - the goal formula (only the formula, i.e., without :goal keyword)
;; constraints - a PDDL3 constraint formula (again, only the formula; it
;;   may be nil, which is interpreted as true)
;; metric - the metric expression (the expression only, i.e., without
;;   :metric and minimize/maximize); should be nil if there is no metric.
;;   the metric can also be a function: this function will be called with
;;   the final state to produce the "value" of the plan (which can be any
;;   kind of value, not only a number).
;; actions - list of domain action schemas
;;   this is an assoc list of (name . definition) pairs, where the
;;   action definition is also an assoc list of (keyword . expresion)
;;   pairs, for keywords :parameters, :precondition, :effect, etc.
;;   note: this function (and those it calls) expects that the action
;;   parameters list is parsed into the internal format (an assoc list
;;   of (name . type) pairs); however, the parameter lists of quantifiers
;;   (in formulas and effects) and axiom heads are expected to be
;;   *unparsed* (i.e., in the PDDL 'name - type' form).
;; stratified-axioms - stratified list of domain axioms; this is a list
;;   of strata, where each stratum is a list of axioms
;; types - list of domain types
;;   this is an assoc list of (type . supertype) pairs
;; objects - list of domain/problem objects
;;   this is an assoc list of (object . type) pairs; note that all
;;   objects must be typed (with type 'object' if nothing else)
;; :visualisation - if not nil, a function of two arguments; will be
;;   called with the plan and the state sequence produced by executing
;;   the plan; if the plan is successful, the length of the state
;;   sequence will be the length of the plan +1; if the plan fails to
;;   execute, the state sequence will include only states up to the
;;   happening that fails.
;; returns:
;;   a list (success value vresult), where success (t/nil) indicates the
;;   plan is valid (executable and achieves the goal), value is the
;;   metric value of the plan (nil if no metric specified), and vresult
;;   is the result of calling the visualisation function, or nil if no

;; Causal link analysis

;; Extract causal links from a plan. This is done by executing the plan
;; (in much the same was as execute-plan does), keeping track of which
;; action was the last to add each atom, and creating causal links for
;; the (positive) preconditions of each action using that information.
;; There are limitations to the current implementation: it does not work
;; with derived predicates (axioms), or fluents (object or number); and
;; it considers every atom read by the precondition of an action as a
;; precondition, which may lead to unintended results if actions have
;; disjunctive conditions or conditional effects.
;; plan - the plan (sans name)
;; state - initial state (same as in execute-plan)
;; actions - the list of actions (same as in execute-plan)
;; stratified-axioms - must be nil ;)
;; types - list of type declarations (same as in execute-plan)
;; objects - list of object declarations (same as in execute-plan)
;; clinks - input list of causal links (may be nil)
;; :producer-cost-select - function used to select/combine two values
;;   for producer-cost; will only be called with two arguments, both of
;;   which are numberp.
;; :consumer-cost-select - function used to select/combine two values
;;   for consumer-cost; will only be called with two arguments, both of
;;   which are numberp.
;; :filter - optional filter function; if given, will be called with the
;;   five elements of each causal link found as arguments, and the link
;;   will only be added to the list if the function return non-nil.
;; Returns: a list of causal links. Each entry in the list is a list
;;  (producer consumer atom pcost ccost), where
;; - producer is the (instantiated) producer action;
;; - consumer is the (instantiated) consumer action;
;; - atom is the (ground) atom provided;
;; - pcost is the value of the (total-cost) fluent in the state after
;;  the happening that includes the producer (may be nil if total-cost
;;  is not defined);
;; - ccost is the value of the (total-cost) fluent in the state after
;;  the happening that includes the consumer (may be nil if total-cost
;;  is not defined).
;; The returned list has at most one entry for each producer-consumer-atom
;; triplet. If the same causal link is found more than once, the
;; producer-cost-select and consumer-cost-select functions are used to
